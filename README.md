# JS ecosystem cleanup

As part of the [e18e](https://e18e.dev) initiative, the ecosystem cleanup
project is a community effort to collaborate on cleaning up technical
debt in the JS ecosystem.

Our goal is to provide a cleaner, faster and simpler dependency tree in the JS
ecosystem for those who are concerned with it.

## How to help

All issues on our issue tracker are labeled and a lot of them contain actionable items you can start to work on right away.
Here are some examples:

The maintainer of the repo was not contacted yet. Create an issue and ask, if creating a PR is welcome. You can also reach out to the maintainer via other channels but **make sure that contributions are welcome**. We want the maintainers on board and convince them that this is important enough to spend time on.

The maintainer is welcoming PRs. Feel free to create PRs for all the issues you find. **Make sure to follow contribution guidelines!**

The package in question needs a replacement that we can bring forward. Feel free to create one. Maitenance burden is on you!
