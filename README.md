# JS ecosystem cleanup

As part of the [e18e](https://e18e.dev) initiative, the ecosystem cleanup
project is a community effort to collaborate on cleaning up technical
debt in the JS ecosystem.

Our goal is to provide a cleaner, faster and simpler dependency tree in the JS
ecosystem for those who are concerned with it.

## How to help

All issues on our issue tracker are labeled and a lot of them contain actionable items you can start to work on right away.
Hence, an explanation of the labels is in order:

A list of repos that contain at least one dependency that can be replaced by a better alternative. Before you submit a PR, create an issue first if no contact has been made yet

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/needs%20first%20contact-b60205?style=flat" alt="needs first contact" style="vertical-align: middle"/>

The maintainer of the repo was not contacted yet. Create an issue and ask, if creating a PR is welcome

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/has%20issue-697830?style=flat" alt="has issue" style="vertical-align: middle"/>

There is an open issue for the repo but no PR yet. If the maintainer gave a positive response, you can go ahead and create a PR

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/accepts%20prs-DBE1EF?style=flat" alt="accepts prs" style="vertical-align: middle"/>

The maintainer is welcoming PRs. Feel free to create PRs for all the issues you find

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/has%20pr-6E4234?style=flat" alt="has pr" style="vertical-align: middle"/>

A PR has been created and waits to be merged. Nothing to do here for now.

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pr%20needs%20update-bfd4f2?style=flat" alt="pr needs update" style="vertical-align: middle"/>

The PR needs to be updated. Either there was a reponse / review by the maintainer or the PR has merge conflicts

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/blocked-1d76db?style=flat" alt="blocked" style="vertical-align: middle"/>

This PR is blocked by some other issue. Check regularly if that issue is resolved

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/rejected-f9d0c4?style=flat" alt="rejected" style="vertical-align: middle"/>

The PR or the idea of a PR has been rejected by the maintainer. Maybe try again after a few months

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/needs%20alternative-F32096?style=flat" alt="needs alternative" style="vertical-align: middle"/>

The package in question needs a replacement that we can bring forward. Feel free to create one. Maitenance burden is on you!
