# e18e ecosystem issues

As part of the [e18e](https://e18e.dev) initiative and community, this
repository is a place to track issues and contributions to projects across
the ecosystem.

These contributions and issues may involve any number of the areas e18e
focuses on. For example, many of the issues are `cleanup`, but some also
contribute to `speedup`.

## Ecosystem clean up

This repository started life as the `ecosystem-cleanup` project, but has since
outgrown that as the community has gone beyond only cleanup contributions. It
has also been officially adopted into the e18e organisation as the primary
issue tracker.

## How to help

All issues on our issue tracker are labeled and a lot of them contain actionable items you can start to work on right away.
Here are some examples:

<a href="https://github.com/es-tooling/ecosystem-cleanup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22needs+first+contact%22"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/needs%20first%20contact-b60205?style=flat" alt="needs first contact" style="vertical-align: middle"/></a>

The maintainer of the repo was not contacted yet. Create an issue and ask per the repo's contributing guidelines.

If an issue was filed more than a couple months ago and hasn't received activity, you can also reach out to the maintainer via other channels listed on the repo but **make sure that contributions are welcome**. We want the maintainers on board and to convince them that this is important enough to spend time on.

The maintainer is welcoming PRs. Feel free to create PRs for all the issues you find. **Make sure to follow contribution guidelines!**

<a href="https://github.com/es-tooling/ecosystem-cleanup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22needs+alternative%22"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/needs%20alternative-F32096?style=flat" alt="needs alternative" style="vertical-align: middle"/></a>

The package in question needs a replacement that we can bring forward. Feel free to create one, but beware: its maintenance burden is on you! Before replacing the package in question, ensure you've explored existing alternatives. Prioritize contributing to or improving those alternatives before deciding to create a new package.

Make sure to test the new package thoroughly and promote it within the community to gain visibility and trust. Avoid migrating any repositories to your new package without first double-checking with the community.
